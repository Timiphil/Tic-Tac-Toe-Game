# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Building a Tic-tac-toe game for human to human and AI to human. This is Two-player turn-based games that is used in Chess, Backgammon, and Mancala, where Two players plays against each other until one of them wins. 

This game is build on **Minimax** algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory. The minimax algorithm checks all the possible combinations from a given position. Then it chooses the best possible move that maximizes the chances of winning, assuming that both players play optimally.

some of the challenges that I encounter when builiding this game are the runtime of thge AI and the algorithm is recursive and the number of executions may become huge. considering a chess game, If I were to write the number of combinations, the entire universe would not be enough. I hope to implement the use of a dictionary which allows searching in counting for storing values. Using this approach can reduce the time complexity.
